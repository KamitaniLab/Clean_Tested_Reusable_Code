Hello everyone and welcome to the `Clean and Reproducible Code` workshop at the [Kamitani Lab](https://kamitani-lab.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/)!

Within these pages, we provide information on how to follow the workshop, as well as respective materials. This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [github repository](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/Clean_Reproducible_Code) and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or jupyter notebook respectively. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).
